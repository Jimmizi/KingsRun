Rules of the dice game.

We recommend you experience the explanation in game. But if you can't wait or
needed to look something up after having already experienced it, scroll down.































































The game is played round by round, each player taking their turn to reroll their dice
once per round.

You'll be asked at the start if the game whether you want to go first in the round
or last in the round.

If you are going first you will be playing as white. Otherwise going second you will be
playing as black.

It is your turn when your shade (black/white) is blinking under the scores.

During your turn, pick up as many dice that you want to reroll and then roll them.
Left click on a die to start holding it. Right click on more dice to add them to
your hand for rerolling.

At least one die must be rerolled per round. During the first round, you'll be forced
to roll all of your dice.

Let go of left click when you are ready to roll your dice.

Following a skull will remove that die from play.

The current scores of the dice present on the table are shown at the top of the screen.
Player on the left. The Dealer on the right.

Rerolling dice, having them knocked over, or having them removed from play will bring
change to your score.

Whoever has the highest score of dice on the table at the end of the last round will win.
